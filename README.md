# Library

(Work in progress...)

Here we have two applications to manage books of libraries.
- Client side application is a desktop app where you can do your own reservations. The same application work for the administrator to add new books, too. Obviously, it will ask for user and password. The GUI will use JavaFX, and the connectivity will use JSon.
- Server side has a SpringBoot app that recibe requests using Rest Apis. This application has connectivity with H2 database.
